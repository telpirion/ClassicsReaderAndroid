# Help

Thank you for installing the _Latin Reader_, a free app for reading classical
works in either Latin or English. 

## Switch pages by touch

* To turn to the next page, tap the right side of the app.
* To turn to the previous page, tap the left side of the app.
* To switch between the source text and the translation, tap the center of
  the app and select the corresponding entry in the menu.
  
## Switch pages by button

* Go to **Settings** and make sure that **Show Page Controls** is checked.
* To turn to the next page, tap the right chevron button.
* To turn to the previous page, tap the left chevron button.

## Scroll through a text

If the page text does not fit entirely into the reading page, you might need
to scroll downwards or upwards to display more text.

## Select a text to read

* Click the hamburger menu at the top left of the app.
  + To read a text in Latin, click **Library**.
  + To read a text in English, click **Translations**.
* Tap the name of the text you want to read.

## Search for a word in the dictionary

* Click the magnifying class icon in the top right corner.
* Enter the dictionary word that you want to look up. 
  
  **Note:** You must use the dictionary entry version of the word rather than
  the stem. For example, "facio" returns a result but "fac" does not.
